# Vagrant 
Command line utility for building and managing virtual machines. Used in conjunction with shell scripts to automatically build consistent and iscol development environments.

## Benefits of Vagrant
- Can launch many things, VirtualBox, VMware, AWS, OpenStack ...
- Vagrant is consistent across platforms because it is entirely iscolated.


## Setup
```
$ vagrant init hashicorp/precise64
$ vagrant up
```
`vagrant init` creates `Vagrantfile` in current directory. Can take one parameter, the `box`.
`vagrant up` launches machine and installs/updates dependencies, based on box template.

## Vagrant Boxes
Vagrant uses base images, called "boxes", to clone instead of building virtual machines from scratch everytime. [Hashicorp's Box Catelog](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search) has many boxes.

## Up and SSH
After `vagrant up`, virtual machine will be running. Run `vagrant ssh` to SSH into the machine. `vagrant suspend` closes the machine. `vagrant destroy` delete the vm.

## Synced Folders
The synced folder on the virtual machine is found in `/vagrant` in root. This is synced to the hosting machine's folder where the `Vagrantfile` is on the host machine. Clone the project to the folder with `Vagrantfile` on host.
