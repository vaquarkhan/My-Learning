# Artificial neural network
A computational approach based on a collection of neural units connected by axons.
- each neural unit holds a function of all of it's inputs, whose output is propagated to other neural units
- typically consist of multiple layers or a cube design where signal path traverses from front to back

### Models
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are simple mathematical models defining `f: X -> Y` or a distribution over X or both X and Y

### Convolutional Neural Networks
Feed-forward neural network: connections between units are acyclic, and is unidirectional
- individual neurons respond to stimuli in a restricted region of space known as the receptive field
- overlap between receptive fields of neruons are the visual field
- convolution is the operation on two first class functions `f` and `g` to produce a third function
  - modified version of one of hte original functions, giving the integral of pointwise multiplication of the two functions
