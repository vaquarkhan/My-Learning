# Network Fundamentals
Define: a network is a collection of computers or hardware devices that are connected physically or logically 
- many obvious benefits, however network infrastructure/maintainence can be expensive

### Network Layers, Models, Architecture
- Networks are conceptually structured in layers, based on level of abstraction.
- The networking model is built upon these layers, describing what each layer does 
- architectures are sets of rules that describe the function of some portion of the hardware or software
