# Networking
Internet allows computers to connect, through more complex routing than a simple ethernet cable.
- routers recieve messages from one computer, make sure that the right computer receives them
- routers can connect to other routers
- utilizing telephone infrastructure, networks can be connected (through a modem, by an ISP)
- to find other computers, use their IP address (which can be aliased as a domain name, easier for humans)
