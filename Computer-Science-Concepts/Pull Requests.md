# Pull Requests
A feature of GitHub and BitBucket for requesting that code is merged to the central repository.

1. Fork a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone repository to local repo. Make changes.
3. Add, commit, push.
4. Navigate to your remote repo that you want your changes to be pulled from. Press `Pull Request`.

### Tips
- **Keep PRs small**
- descriptive title
- answer what the PR accomplishes
- how does it accomplish this
- Ping specific people (2 people) not entire teams
- answer "what could go wrong"
- list rollback steps
