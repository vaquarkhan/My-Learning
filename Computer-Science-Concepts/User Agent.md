# User Agent
A **user agent** is a software agent that acts on behalf of the user. The user agent acts as a client in a network protocol.
- when a software agent operates in a network protocol, it identifies itself, its application type, operating system, software vendor
- in HTTP, identification (User-Agent string) is transmitted in a header field *User-Agent*
- standard for bots to include a URL/email address

### Robot exclusion standard (robot.txt)
A site owner wishes to give instructions to a web robot will place a text file, `robot.txt` in root of the website. The file functions as a request that robots do not access certain pages, for example out of preference for privacy from search engine results, or avoidance of misleading categorization of a site. Search engines follow this standard.

`robot.txt` is not a useful means of security for restricting access from bots. Security by obscurity is not encouraged and not secure.
